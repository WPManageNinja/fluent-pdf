Generate PDF from Your Form Submissions and Download/Email Them

== Description ==
**PDF Addon for Fluent Forms is the supplement you will need to automatically generate PDF files based on what users submit on the forms you created with Fluent Forms.**

If you are looking forward to generate PDF files based on user submitted entries on your Fluent Forms plugin, this add-on is the perfect solution for you. With this add-on, you will be able to hand out to your users custom PDF files with your company logo engraved as a watermark, custom cover letter, dynamic personalised form entry summary or even payment invoices.

The plugin comes with a customisable PDF template. Within a minute, you will be able to set up personalised PDF template with your company name, logo, entry date, dynamic personalisation, body text font family, size, color, PDF page orientation and the paper size. To automatically personalise the PDF files for every form entry, you can use shortcodes that will fetch the form input by themselves so that you don't have to sweat over it.

You can also send these PDF files via emails to your users and make them password-protected with just a few clicks.
